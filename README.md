# Workflow Optimization & Delay Prediction System
End-to-End Data Analytics & ML Project (SQL|Python|Power BI)


## 🔍 Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world IT services delivery environment and focuses on:
Workflow bottleneck detection
Resource utilization optimization
Cost overrun analysis
Delay risk prediction using Machine Learning
Executive-level Power BI dashboard for decision support
The goal is to help project managers and delivery heads identify inefficiencies, predict delays, and optimize workforce allocation.

 
## 🧩 Business Problems Solved
Why are projects getting delayed?
Which tasks are bottlenecks?
Which employees are overloaded or underutilized?
Is skill mismatch causing inefficiency?
Which projects/tasks are likely to be delayed in future?
Where are cost overruns happening?


## 🗂️ Dataset Structure
Tables (SQL)
projects – Project details
tasks – Task-level planning vs actuals
employees – Skills, experience, cost
resource allocation – Who worked on what & utilization
delays – Delay days & reasons
cost tracking – Planned vs actual cost


## 📊 Key KPIs
On-Time Delivery %
Average Resource Utilization
Cost Overrun %
Average Delay Days
Delay Risk Probability (ML)
Overloaded Resources (>110%)
