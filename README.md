# Workflow Delay & Resource Optimization to Reduce Project Cost Overruns
End-to-End Data Analytics & ML Project (SQL|Python|Power BI)


## 🔍 Project Overview
This project simulates a real-world IT services delivery environment and focuses on:
Workflow bottleneck detection
Resource utilization optimization
Cost overrun analysis
Delay risk prediction using Machine Learning
Executive-level Power BI dashboard for decision support
The goal is to help project managers and delivery heads identify inefficiencies, predict delays, and optimize workforce allocation.

 
## 🧩 Business Problems Solved
IT service projects often face delivery delays and cost overruns due to inefficient task allocation, skill mismatches, and poor resource utilization. This project analyzes workflow delays and resource usage to identify optimization opportunities and reduce cost impact.


## Objectives
dentify tasks causing maximum delays
Quantify delay-driven cost overruns
Analyze resource utilization and idle cost
Detect skill mismatches impacting productivity
Recommend data-driven resource reallocation decisions


## 🗂️ Dataset Structure
Tables (SQL)
projects – Project details
tasks – Task-level planning vs actuals
employees – Skills, experience, cost
resource allocation – Who worked on what & utilization
delays – Delay days & reasons
cost tracking – Planned vs actual cost


## 📊 Key KPIs
Delay Rate (%)
Average Delay Days
Delay Impact Cost (₹)
Resource Utilization (%)
Idle Cost (₹)
Skill Match (%)
Productivity Loss (₹)


## Tools & Technologies
SQL (Analysis & Aggregations)
Power BI (Data Modeling, DAX, Dashboards)
Excel / CSV (Data preparation)


## 📈 Power BI Dashboard Pages
1.Executive Summary – High-level cost and delay impact
2.Delay & Cost Analysis – Root cause of delays
3.Resource Optimization – Utilization and idle cost
4.Skill Mismatch Analysis – Allocation quality
5.Decision Simulator – Before vs After cost impact


## 🎯 What This Project Demonstrates
End-to-end analytics pipeline (SQL → Python → ML → Power BI)
Real business problem solving
Consulting-style storytelling with data
Industry-relevant KPIs for IT service companies
Predictive analytics, not just descriptive


##🔹 Decision Log
Reallocated skill-matched resources to high-delay tasks
Optimized workload for underutilized senior resources
Reduced idle cost and potential delay impact by ~20%


##🔹 Key Insights
40%+ delays originated from a small set of tasks
Skill mismatches significantly increased delay duration
High-cost resources were underutilized, increasing idle cost
Data-driven reallocation showed measurable cost reduction


##Business Impact
This analysis demonstrates how workflow optimization and strategic resource allocation can reduce project delays and minimize labor cost overruns in IT service environments.
