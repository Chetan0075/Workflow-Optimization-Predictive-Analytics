# Mega Project Theme:



**“Workflow Bottleneck Detection \& Resource Optimization using Predictive Analytics”**

**(Enterprise IT services company like TCS / Infosys)**









##### We will simulate:

1. Projects
2. Employees / Teams
3. Tasks
4. Deadlines
5. Skill matching
6. Delays
7. Cost
8. Utilization









##### Project Scope \& Objectives:



Problem Statement: Many large companies, like TCS and Infosys, face challenges in optimizing their workflows and resource allocation. Inefficiencies can lead to increased costs and reduced productivity.



Objectives: The project aims to develop a predictive analytics model that identifies workflow bottlenecks and forecasts resource demand. This will help the company streamline operations, reduce costs, and improve overall efficiency.









##### Key Metrics/KPIs:



* Workflow Efficiency: Measure the time taken for tasks to complete before and after optimization.
* Resource Utilization: Track the percentage of resources effectively used versus idle time.
* Cost Reduction: Quantify cost savings from improved workflow and resource allocation.
* Forecast Accuracy: Compare predicted resource demand against actual demand.
