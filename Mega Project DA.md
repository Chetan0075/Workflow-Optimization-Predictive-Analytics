Mega Project Theme:

“Workflow Bottleneck Detection & Resource Optimization using Predictive Analytics”
(Enterprise IT services company like TCS / Infosys)




We will simulate:
Projects
Employees / Teams
Tasks
Deadlines
Skill matching
Delays
Cost
Utilization




Project Scope & Objectives:

Problem Statement: Many large companies, like TCS and Infosys, face challenges in optimizing their workflows and resource allocation. Inefficiencies can lead to increased costs and reduced productivity.

Objectives: The project aims to develop a predictive analytics model that identifies workflow bottlenecks and forecasts resource demand. This will help the company streamline operations, reduce costs, and improve overall efficiency.




Key Metrics/KPIs:

Workflow Efficiency: Measure the time taken for tasks to complete before and after optimization.
Resource Utilization: Track the percentage of resources effectively used versus idle time.
Cost Reduction: Quantify cost savings from improved workflow and resource allocation.
Forecast Accuracy: Compare predicted resource demand against actual demand.
